## Web LLM Attacks

- "Excessive agency" - Situation in which an LLM has access to APIs that can access senstive information and can be persuaded to use those APIs unsafely. Enables attackers to push the LLM beyond its intended scope and launch attacks via its APIs. 
- First step to exploit excessive agency is to figure out which plugins and APIs the LLM has access to. This can be done through various methods, such as asking the LLM directly, providing misleading context, etc.
